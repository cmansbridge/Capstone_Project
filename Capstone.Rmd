# Capstone Project: Average Energy Pricing and Resources -- Effect of Temperature
The goal of this project is to analyze data from the average day ahead energy prices and energy resources from across the UK.  The average monthly UK temperature from the same time period will also be plotted to see if there is any correlation between temperature, price and resource mix.

##Who Cares About This?

The primary user of this data analysis would be energy traders and energy facilities managers and investors.
This project will be useful to see if there is any correlation between energy price, temperature and resource mix.

## What Data Will I Use?
I will be using data from the OFGEM and UK government weather website.  All the data is downloadable.

## Approach
I will organize the average monthly data into a clean dataframe. I will create graphical analysis of the temperature versus pricing, temperature versus resource mix and price versus resource mix to determine if there is any correlation.

## Deliverables
I will deliver the R code used to analyze the data, the written analysis to accompany and any applicable graphs.
